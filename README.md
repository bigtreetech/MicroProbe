# MicroProbe-Terminator

##Fix the bracket being 4mm too long for correct fitment to Terminator extruder

original stl/step had probe sitting 2mm below nozzle when pin retracted
which is how far below the nozzle the pin should be when extended
pin extends 4mm so i shortened the bracket by 4mm
(probe now moves from approx -2mm to +2mm in relation to the nozzle)
